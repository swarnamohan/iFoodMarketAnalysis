Data analysis of iFood's customer and campaign data

A new campaign aims to sell a gadget to the Customer Database. A pilot campaign involved 2,240 randomly selected customers who were contacted by phone, which cost 6,720MU and generated 3,674MU in revenue. This resulted in a global profit of -3,046MU and a 15% success rate. 

The objective is to develop a model that predicts customer behavior and to apply it to the rest of the customer base. The model will allow the company to cherry pick customers who are most likely to purchase the offer, while leaving out the non-respondents, making the next campaign highly profitable. Moreover, the CMO is interested in understanding to study the characteristic features of those customers who are willing to buy the gadget.

Objectives:
Customer profile analysis - identify prevalent characteristics & behaviors among our customers

Create correlation matrix for correlation analysis of variables

Customer segmentation

Predictive model and recommendations for next campaign to target select customers
